# Apple Terminal (Terminal.app) driver. Terminal has NO scriptable split panes
# (its ⌘D "Split Pane" is a same-session view, and AppleScript exposes only
# windows→tabs), so the dock is a SEPARATE window positioned beside the frontmost
# one — the scriptable equivalent of manual macOS Split View tiling. `do script`
# opens a new window and returns its tab. First use triggers the one-time TCC
# Automation approval (osascript error -1743 until granted). Sourced — bash-3.2-safe.
#
# CLOSING is the hard part, and two Terminal quirks shape this driver:
#  1. AppleScript silently refuses to close a window with a running process (the
#     dock runs brief-view.sh), and `saving no` only covers the *save* dialog.
#     Assigning a "never prompt" profile doesn't help — close behaviour is bound at
#     window-creation, which `do script` can't influence. Only an IDLE window
#     closes cleanly. So tdrv_close KILLS the window's processes first, then closes.
#  2. `first window whose id is N` is unreliable (intermittent "Invalid index"),
#     which breaks looking up the window's tty at close time. So we CAPTURE the tty
#     at open (from the fresh tab) and encode it in the id token ("<winid>:<tty>"),
#     and we close by ITERATING windows rather than by `whose id`.

tdrv_detect(){ [ "${TERM_PROGRAM:-}" = Apple_Terminal ]; }

# $TERM_SESSION_ID is `wXtYpZ:UUID` (or a bare UUID on some builds); the wXtYpZ
# prefix is positional/unstable, the UUID is the stable token. Hex+dash only.

# The dock's "brief" settings set (the profile your Terminal uses + 1.2× line spacing)
