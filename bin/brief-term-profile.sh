# Create the Apple Terminal "brief" settings set the dock uses — a copy of the
# profile YOUR Terminal currently uses, plus 1.2× line spacing (and an optional font
# bump via $BRIEF_FONT_BUMP). Run it FROM Terminal: it reads the front window's
# profile, so the dock matches what you actually use. It imports the profile via
# `open` (which flashes one Terminal window — just close it) ONLY if "brief" isn't
# already present, so it's safe/idempotent to re-run. To rebuild from a different
# profile, delete the "brief" profile first (Settings ▸ Profiles ▸ brief ▸ –), then
# re-run. The driver (bin/term/darwin/terminal.sh) applies "brief" to the dock if it exists,
# else inherits the session profile — so this is optional; it only adds the spacing.
#
# Why a static, install-time profile (not created live on /brief): line spacing
# (FontHeightSpacing) is only settable by importing a .terminal, and that import
# opens a login-shell window Terminal won't let us close cleanly. Doing it once at
# install keeps that one transient window out of the per-/brief path.
