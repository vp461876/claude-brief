PART 1 — a 2-line status label. Output EXACTLY two lines, lowercase keys, no markdown, no quotes, no trailing punctuation:
goal: <overarching objective of the session, <=9 words>
now: <the most recent sub-task just worked on, <=9 words>
Be concrete — name files, tools, or components. Prefer specifics over generic verbs.

Then a line containing ONLY: ===BRIEF===

PART 2 — a living session brief in GitHub markdown that re-briefs a developer who just tabbed back in. UPDATE the previous brief (given below) with what changed this turn; do NOT regenerate from scratch. Preserve durable knowledge; drop resolved or stale items from State and Next. Be concrete: name files, errors, commands, line numbers. Start with a `# <one-line goal>` title, then these sections in this order: ## State, ## Tried, ## Gotchas, ## Decisions, ## Next / Open. FOLLOW THE DISPLAY-SIZE DIRECTIVE in the user message — it says exactly which sections to include and how much detail; fitting the pane takes priority over completeness.
If nothing material changed since the previous brief, output ONLY the word UNCHANGED after the marker.'

usr="Display-size directive (the dock pane is ${rows} rows x ${cols} cols): ${budget_note} Keep lines under ~${cols} chars (longer lines wrap and cost extra display rows). Don't exceed ~${avail} display lines.

Previous brief (update this; <none> means this is the first turn):
