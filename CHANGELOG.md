# Changelog

All notable changes to **claude-brief** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

A note on tags vs. this file: releases are cut by tagging the feature commit
(`git tag -a vX.Y.Z … && git push origin vX.Y.Z`). The release workflow then stamps
that version into the tarball's `plugin.json` and commits the bump to `main` — so the
bump commit always lands one commit *after* the tag. The dates below are the release
dates.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- Summariser no longer emits a "restore project context" brief instead of a
  summary. The default CLI summariser runs `claude -p` from an empty neutral
  working dir (`.sumcwd`), and Claude Code injects that environment (cwd, "not a
  git repository") into the system prompt; the model could treat it as ground
  truth, see it conflict with a transcript about a real git project, and report a
  context mismatch. The system prompt now fences the summariser off from its own
  runtime environment — the transcript is its sole source of truth.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- `latest release:` line in the debug `[install]` section — an anonymous,
  fail-soft (5s) check against the GitHub releases API, so stale-version bug
  reports identify themselves. Disclosed in PRIVACY.md.
- Manual-install docs now list the optional `SessionStart` hook line — it's what
  surfaces missing-dep and rejected-`BRIEF_SUMMARIZER` warnings at session start;
  the plugin wires it automatically, but manual installs previously had those
  warnings written to state and never shown.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- `/brief debug` — a sanitised, copy-pasteable diagnostic report for bug reports.
  Collects by allowlist (versions, state-file ages, the last outcome and backoff
  status, summariser resolution incl. why an override was rejected, env-var
  *presence and length* only — never values — and one 20s-capped probe summary
  call with scrubbed stderr). `$HOME` renders as `~`; key-shaped strings are
  masked. When an auto-selected API probe fails, the CLI fallback is probed too —
  mirroring the worker — so a failing-but-recovering setup reads as exactly that.
  Safe to paste into a public GitHub issue.
- `[dock]` section in the debug report: detection signals (presence only), the
  detected driver vs any override, self-pane resolution, the dock session's
  driver vs the currently-detected one (mismatch flagged), a per-backend
  `tdrv_preflight` probe (tmux server ping, `kitty @ ls` over the socket,
  `wezterm cli`, osascript Automation checks with TCC `-1743` called out — new
  OPTIONAL driver-contract hook, see DEVELOPING.md), and the **last dock error**:
  a failed `tdrv_open`'s stderr is now persisted to `state/.brief-dock-err`
  (cleared on the next successful open) instead of being discarded.

- **Privacy-preserving failure classification**: each failed summary attempt's
  stderr is matched against fixed signatures and reduced to an enum (`timeout`,
  `auth`, `network`, `permission-rule`, `api-error:<type>`, …) persisted to
  `state/<sid>.brief.err`; the stderr **text is discarded, never written to
  disk** — a live call's error output could echo conversation fragments. The
  debug report shows it as `last failure:`; cleared on the next success.
- **Backoff countdown in the dock footer** — during the 10-minute failure
  backoff the footer now shows *"summary failing — auto-retry in ~Nm"* instead
  of a stale "summary failed".
- `login-shell bash:` probe in the debug `[dock]` section — the dock pane runs
  the viewer under a login-shell PATH, where bash 3.2 makes the pane open and
  instantly die.
- README **Troubleshooting** section (the two looks-broken-but-isn't cases:
  cost-gated trivial turns, failure backoff) + a GitHub issue template that asks
  for the `/brief debug` output; PRIVACY.md now documents exactly what the debug
  report does and does not collect.

### Fixed
- The API summariser now reports the error response's `type`/`message` fields on
  stderr (length-capped, never the raw response) instead of exiting silently.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- `/brief help` subcommand — usage, the in-dock keys, and docs pointers; needs no
  session or dock. A one-time first-run hint after the first dock open points at
  the dock's `?` key and `help`.

### Fixed
- **CLI summariser pins the session's effective endpoint** via a `--settings` env
  override. Claude Code applies settings-file env over process env, so from the
  summariser's neutral cwd a global settings-env `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (e.g. a
  corporate gateway) re-pointed the inner `claude -p` even when the session's own
  project settings had blanked it — and the unauthenticated gateway call hung
  until the watchdog killed it, so no brief was ever produced.
- A rejected `BRIEF_SUMMARIZER` override is no longer silent: the reason (no such
  file, literal `~`, outside `~/.claude`, bad perms…) is written to
  `state/.brief-summarizer-warn` and surfaced at session start — and a rejected
  override now counts as unset, so summariser auto-selection still applies.
- Dropped the removed `SlashCommand` tool from the inner claude's disallowed-tools
  list (Claude Code ≥2.1.x warned on it); `Skill` is disallowed instead.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Auto-select the direct-API summariser on API-billed sessions** — when the session
  authenticates via `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, an approved `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or any
  `BRIEF_API_*` / `brief-summarizer.env` config, the brief is generated by a direct
  Messages-API call (~5× cheaper than the `claude -p` CLI path). Subscription (OAuth)
  sessions are never switched. Opt out with `BRIEF_AUTO_API=0`.

### CI / docs
- Guard against internal hostnames in tracked files.
- Cache the downloads badge; surface the summariser auto-selection in the privacy
  blurb and comparison table.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-09

### Security
- Address security-review findings F1–F7: argv hygiene in the dock drivers,
  AppleScript string escaping, a safe default API base URL, and session-id
  validation. The repo history was also scrubbed as part of this release.

### Added
- `PRIVACY.md` — what each summary call sends, local storage, and retention.
- Plugin manifest keywords for directory/search indexing.

### CI / docs
- Run the full regression suite on macOS in CI (real-terminal e2e skips under CI).
- Command and in-dock-key tables in the README; plugin command
  (`/claude-brief:brief`) used consistently throughout.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-06-09

*(The v1.2.0 and earlier tags/releases were withdrawn during the v1.2.1 history scrub.)*

### Fixed
- Harden the plugin dependency preflight: fail loud on missing required deps and
  stop assuming Homebrew is installed when printing install hints.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Claude Code plugin packaging** — install via
  `/plugin marketplace add tigerquoll/claude-brief`: self-hosting
  `marketplace.json`, auto-wired hooks (`hooks.json`), and a SessionStart hook for
  fresh-user setup (iTerm2 profile + dependency check).
- Tag-triggered release workflow that stamps `plugin.json` from the release tag and
  syncs the bump back to `main`.

### Changed
- Unified layout: the repo root is the plugin root; `install.sh` deploys the same
  self-locating tree to `~/.claude` for the manual path.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-06-09

Initial public release (pre-plugin): the per-session brief generated by a cost-gated
Haiku call on the `Stop` hook, docked beside the session with pluggable terminal
backends (iTerm2, tmux, kitty, WezTerm, ghostty, Apple Terminal, generic fallback),
manual `~/.claude` install via `install.sh`, and release tarballs.
